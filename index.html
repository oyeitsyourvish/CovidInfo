            <p>
                Government of India is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the
                challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID 19 – the Corona Virus. With active
                support of the people of India, we have been able to contain the spread of the Virus in our country.
                The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens
                with the right information and taking precautions as per the advisories being issued by Ministry of
                Health & Family Welfare.

                <p>
                    Q: What are the symptoms of the coronavirus disease?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: The most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In
                    more severe cases infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and even death.
                    The period within which the symptoms would appear is 2-14 days.

                    Q: What is the recovery time for the coronavirus disease?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases
                    is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.

                    Q: How long does the coronavirus last on surfaces?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to
                    behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary
                    information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.

                    Q: How long does COVID-19 immunity last in some people?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: 
                    Though immunity through vaccination is expected to last up to nine months as 'we now know', Dr. Satish said a lot of studies were under way to see if everyone requires a booster dose once a year, like the flu-shot in some countries

                <p>
                    Q: Has anyone gotten Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Most people who get COVID-19 are unvaccinated. However, since vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, some people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19. An infection of a fully vaccinated person is referred to as a “vaccine breakthrough infection.”

                <p>
                    Q: Could COVID-19 become endemic or a constant presence?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: 
                    Scientists predict COVID will become endemic over time but there will still be sporadic outbreaks where it gets out of control. The transition from pandemic to endemic will likely play out differently in different locations around the world.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A: 
                    The global health agency this week said that it suspended its review process of the vaccine, citing concerns over the manufacturing practices at production plants inside Russia and whether the vaccine can be consistently produced to the necessary standard

                </p>
                <p>
                    A: 
                    Most side effects happen within the first three days after vaccination and typically last only 1 to 2 days.

                <p>
                    A: 
                    Covishield, which is the Astra Zeneca vaccine produced in India, is the most widely recognised vaccine for travel in the EU after those approved by EMA.

                <p>
                    A: 
                    The most common side effects include a sore arm, fatigue (feeling tired), headache, aches, and fever. Side effects are a good sign — they indicate that the vaccine is working by triggering the immune system.
